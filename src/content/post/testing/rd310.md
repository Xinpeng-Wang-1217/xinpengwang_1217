Today we had an online seminar given by Keisuke Inomata (JHU) about the one-loop correction in scalar perturbation for SR-NSR-SR type inflation based on his works .
He said that by imposing the zero-tadpole condition $\langle\zeta\rangle=0$, the conterterms $V_{c,(1)}$ and $V_{c,(2)}$ appears, which cancels out the 1-loop terms sourced from $V_{(3)}$.

During the Random Discussion, Xiaohan presented a work on delta N formalism in multi-brid inflation.
